# POC Synchronize Markdown files with Confluence

Proof of concept project aimed at enabling the automatic synchronization of Markdown files with Confluence

## üîÆ About

The [poc-sync-markdown-with-confluence](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/poc-sync-markdown-with-confluence) is a project or proof of concept (POC) that aims to synchronize markdown files with [Jira Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence)

This POC explores the possibility of syncing markdown files stored in a version control system like Git with Confluence, with a simple automation managed with Github Actions. The motivation behind this project is to streamline the content creation process and make it easier for teams to collaborate on documentation. With the ability to sync markdown files with Confluence, teams can continue using their preferred text editor and version control system while seamlessly updating and publishing content on Confluence.

There are several benefits to synchronizing markdown files with Confluence. First and foremost, it allows teams to leverage the simplicity and flexibility of markdown for content creation. Markdown is easy to learn and write, making it accessible to everyone on the team. Additionally, since markdown files are plain text, they can be easily versioned, compared, and merged using Git or any other version control system.

## üì° Usage

There are two pipelines in this project:

- [check-pr.yml](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/poc-sync-markdown-with-confluence/blob/main/.github/workflows/check-pr.yml) checks every file with a markdown linter on every pull request made against `main` branch.
- [publish.yml](https://github.com/UlisesGascon/poc-sync-markdown-with-confluence/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yml) same as `check-pr.yml` but also smart publishes the markdown files to Confluence.
